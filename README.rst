chko-r
======

A random mix of exercises and texts,
previously part of chcko,
but now a separate package within the ``chcko`` namespace.

``chko-r`` is an example of content for ``chcko``.

Image files are compied to ``chcko/_images``.
They need to have a globally unique name.
Use ``<author_id>_<problem_id>_xxx`` scheme, e.g ``.. texfigure:: r_dg_c1.tex``.

WORK IN PROGRESS
